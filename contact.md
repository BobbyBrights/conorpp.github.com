I love to meet others and keep in touch.  Feel free to reach out, whether if you have questions, want some advice, or just want to chat.

You can reach me by <a href="mailto:conorpp94@gmail.com">email</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/_conorpp">Twitter</a>, or just commenting on one of my posts.

I'm also on [Discord](https://discordapp.com/) most nights at 10 PM EST.  I made a server for anyone that wants
to drop in and chat.  Use invite code ZjPkykJ.

If you're not familiar with [Discord](https://discordapp.com/), it's like Slack but for both text and voice.
Very popular among gamers and well designed.
