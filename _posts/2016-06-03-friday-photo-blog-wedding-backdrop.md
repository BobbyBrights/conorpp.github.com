# Friday squid blogging

Inspired by [Bruce Schneiers Squid blogging](https://www.schneier.com/cgi-bin/mt/mt-search.cgi?search=squid&__mode=tag&IncludeBlogs=2&limit=10&page=1),
I decided to start friday photo blogging.  In my spare time I like to take photos.  So every Friday I will post a photo of mine.  

I think photography is a balance between art and technical documentation.  In my posts I will explain
my technical and artful motivations.  I also hope to get feedback.

# My sisters wedding

Recently I was fortunate to be the photographer for my sisters wedding.  I got paid in beer -- [Allagash White mostly](http://www.allagash.com/beer/white/),
which I highly recommend.

Most of the photos I took were not planned.  I just tried to observe everything that was going on and document it the best I could.
My goal was that people could remember everything that happened by seeing the pictures.

I did have one planned photo session, however.  This was for a formal portrait of the bride and groom.  I previously acquired
some white lighting stands and "borrowed" a large white table cloth from the wedding location.  Using these, I constructed
this backdrop while the bride and groom were getting ready.

This picture is not intended to be good but it's the best I have that shows the setup.  It's a giant table
cloth that's been hung over a curtain rung.  Notice that the cloth is slightly lit up behind with white light from the sun.
This was key for making a pure white background.

Now check out how it looks, unedited, with the bride and groom in focus and closer such that the cloth covers the entire field of view:

In the previous photo, since the bright cloth was in focus, the exposure time was very low,
resulting in a dark photo.  With the lesser lit bride in groom in focus, my camera increased its
exposure time to better capture the lighting of the subjects while making the cloth quite bright.

Even though the cloth is brighter, an astute reader should point out that the cloth should still have
enough detail to still look like a hanging cloth.  But it looks "pure" white.  There is one more
factor at play: [bokeh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bokeh).  Bokeh is a hipster term refering to the
quality of the not-in-focus parts of the image.  I purposely had the subjects step at least two feet away from
the cloth so it would be outside of the depth of field and as a result, out of focus.

So stolen table cloths, lighting, and bokeh are good technical considerations for formal pictures.  But
I wouldn't claim any art in this photo just yet.  I definitely think it is a good photo, but I don't necessarily
feel any emotion inspired from it.  This is a not-so-tangible part of photography I don't quite understand yet.
I think it would have been good to try different poses and attempt to get the bride and groom to forget about me
and the backdrop setting.  That way they would be more likely to be overwhelmed with the feelings that getting married
people feel.  And they would look at each other all feely emotion blah blah and there's an artful photo opportunity.
