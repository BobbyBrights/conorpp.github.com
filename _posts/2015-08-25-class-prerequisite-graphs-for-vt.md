Here are the class prerequisite graphs for all of the departments at Virginia Tech (Fall 2015).
Sorry for those that are bandwidth impaired.
It was made by scraping this [page](https://banweb.banner.vt.edu/ssb/prod/HZSKVTSC.P_DispRequest)
and passing the results to a graph function in Wolfram Language.  [Source code](https://github.com/conorpp/VT-Prereq-Tree-Generator/blob/master/source.m) (sorry it's messy).

I'm missing ENGL, STAT, and ISE.
