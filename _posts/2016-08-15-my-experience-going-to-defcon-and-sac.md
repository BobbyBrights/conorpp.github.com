I just attended Defcon 24 in Las Vegas and went to SAC (Selected Areas in Cryptography) afterwards.

# Defcon

Defcon is a great conference that hosts around 15k people every year.  People come to share their
research in infosec and exploits that have developed over the past year.  Some people come to partake
in the various competitions or solve the badge puzzle.  And of course there are the parties that various
vendors and groups throw.

I got to LV a day early so I could attend the unoffical Defcon Shoot.  It's where a bunch of people
bring guns to go shoot in the desert.  I didn't have anything to bring but most people are nice and let
you shoot their weapons for the cost of ammo.  I got to put 100 rounds through an M60:

## The Villages

In addition to the official talk tracks put on
by Defcon, there are the villages.  The villages are separate groups that focus on more specific parts
of security.  Each village typically hosts their own set of talks or competitions.  
To list the different Villages from this year:

* Bio Hacking
* Car Hacking
* Crypto and Privacy
* Hardware Hacking
* IoT
* Lockpick
* Packet Hacking
* Social Engineering
* Tamper Evident

I spent a lot of time in the [Crypto and Privacy
Village](https://cryptovillage.org/) this year as they often have talks I'm
interested in.  I also learned a little bit about getting past tamper evident
envelopes and tape at the Tamper Evident Village which was fun.  

One of my friends went to the Bio Hacking Village and got an NFC chip inserted
into his hand:

It's supposed to last for life (or until you remove it surgically).  We of
course first programmed it with this [link](https://youtu.be/dQw4w9WgXcQ) to
pop up anyone's phone that read his hand.

But my favorite part about Defcon is getting to meet new people and catch up with old friends.

I met the
folks behind [AND!XOR](https://twitter.com/ANDnXOR) and learned about their creation
of the Bender Badge:
