title: Looking for work in government

I'm currently looking for work in the U.S. government.

I'm a [Cybercorps](https://www.nsf.gov/funding/pgm_summ.jsp?pims_id=504991) student,
meaning I'm on a scholarship that obligates me
to work for the goverment in security for at least 3 years after I finish school.  Alternatively
I could work for any company that can handle paying off my potential school debt.

I could work for public universities, national labs, state offices, 3 letter agencies, military, etc.

I enjoy working on technical related projects and working in security.  I want
to work on projects that do good.  I don't want to work on projects regarding
[surveilance](http://arstechnica.com/security/2015/12/unauthorized-code-in-juniper-firewalls-decrypts-encrypted-vpn-traffic/)
or the [weakening of existing cryptosystems](http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2016/02/judge-apple-must-help-fbi-unlock-san-bernardino-shooters-iphone/).

If you have an idea for something I would be a good fit for, please send me [an email](/resume.html).
